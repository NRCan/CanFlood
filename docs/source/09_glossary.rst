Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEP)
                                     The inverse of ARI.
Annual Recurrence Intervals (ARI)
                                 The statistical expectation of time between events derived from some observed time-series (e.g., a 100 ARI magnitude flood or larger has occurred 10 times in the past 1000 years). The inverse of an event’s ARI is the annual exceedance probability of that event (e.g., a 100 ARI flood has a 1% chance of occurring each year). Often, the suffix ‘ARI’ is replaced with ‘-year’ (e.g., a 100 ARI flood is equivalent to a 100-year flood). 
Area of Interest (AOI)
                      The spatial extents of the study or model
Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
                                 System used to locate and project spatial information.
Estimated Annualized Damages (EAD)
                                  Expected value of impacts. See :numref:`sec-05-riskL2`.
Flood Risk Assessments (FRA)
                            A formal process of evaluating and quantifying flood risk
Graphical User Interface (GUI) object (or property) level mitigation measures (PLPM)
                                                                                    Interventions acting at the micro- or property-scale like backflow valves or sandbagging.
Rapid Flood Damage Assessment Tool (RFDA)
                                         QGIS plugin developed by IBI Group and the Province of Alberta for object-based flood risk calculations (IBI Group and Golder Associates 2015)
                         The height of some water above some datum. Not to be confused with ‘water depth’ which is a water height above ground.
Web Coverage Service (WCS)
                          Protocol for spatial data over the internet
