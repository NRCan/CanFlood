name,option,type expectation,default,description
name,,str,,name of the scenario/model run
cid,,,,index column for the 3 inventoried data sets (finv expos gels)
prec,,int,,float precision for calculations
ground_water,,bool,,flag to include negative depths in the analysis
felv,,str,,datum or ground
event_probs,,str  ,ari,format of event probabilities (in evals data file) .  
,aep,,,event probabilities in aeps file expressed as  annual exceedance probabilities
,ari,,, expressed as annual recurrance intervals
ltail,,None ,extrapolate,zero probability event  handle  
,flat,,, zero probability event equal to the most extreme impacts in the passed series
,extrapolate,,, set the zero probability event by extrapolating from  the most extreme impact (interp1d)
,none  ,,,do not extrapolate (not recommended)
,float,,,use the passed value as the zero probability impact value  
rtail,,None,0.5, zero impacts event  handle     
,extrapolate ,,,set the zero impact event by extrapolating from the  least extreme impact
,none,,,no enforcing of a zero impact event (not recommended)
,flat ,,, duplicates the minimum AEP as the zero damage event (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
,float ,,, use the passed value as the zero impacts aep value
drop_tails,,bool,FALSE, EAD extrapolation: whether to remove the extrapolated values  before writing the per asset results 
integrate,,str,, numpy integration method to apply (default trapz)
as_inun,,bool,, flag whether to treat exposures as %inundation

,max,,,  maximum expected value of impacts per asset from the duplicated events resolved damage = max(damage w/o fail damage w/ fail * fail prob) default til 2020-12-30
,mutEx,,, assume each event is mutually exclusive (only one can happen) (lower bound)
,indep,,, assume each event is independent (failure of one does not influence the other) (upper bound)
impact_units,,str,, value to label impacts axis with (generally set by Dmg2)
apply_miti,,bool,, whether to apply mitigation algorthihims
curve_deviation,,str,," for L2 damage function libraries, specify the deviation (optional)"
