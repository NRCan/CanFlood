"The devastation of the 2013 Southern Alberta and Toronto Floods triggered"
" a transition in Canada from the traditional standards-based approach, "
"where flood protection is designed for a single level-of-safety, towards "
"a risk-based approach. This new risk-based approach recognizes that "
"robust planning must consider vulnerability and the full range of floods "
"that may harm a community rather than focus on a single, arbitrary, "
"design event. Further, a risk-based view allows decision makers to "
"quantitatively optimize mitigations for their community, helping "
"jurisdictions with shrinking budgets spread protections further. The "

"To quantify risk, modern risk assessments integrate data on the natural "

"management, a risk analysis is highly sensitive to the spatial components"
" of risk: vulnerability (what has been built where and how harmful are "
"flood waters?) and hazard (where and how intense can flooding be?). "
"Evaluating these components is typically accomplished with a chain of "
"activities like data collection, processing, modelling, and post-"
"processing to arrive at the desired risk metrics. The core components of "
"a typical flood risk assessment are the hazard assessment to synthesize "
"spatial exposure-likelihood data sets and a damage assessment to estimate"

"Historically, flood management has involved decisions based on a single "

" This approach has left many communities under-defended and likely "

" 2016). In response to this, modern flood management recognizes the "
"necessity of comprehensive risk-based assessments that evaluate a range "
"of events and their probability and consequences in management planning. "
"CanFlood was designed to support modern risk-based management by "
"integrating a range of flood events (e.g., 10-year, 50-year, 100-year, "
"200-year events) and their probabilities into risk-based models that "
"calculate risk-metrics. However, because CanFlood calculates event-based "

"Exposure-based (L1) assessments quantify the probability of binary "
"exposure of assets to flooding (wet vs. dry). This can be useful for "
"initial assessments, where resources and data are limited, to identify "
"areas for further study. In CanFlood, this is accomplished by collecting "
"data, building a Risk (L1) model, running the model, and evaluating the "
"results. Unlike vulnerability-based assessments (L2, Section3.2_), "
"exposure-based (L1) assessments do not capture the influence of flood "
"depth on risk. In other words, a house with some ponding in the yard "
"would be counted the same as a house fully under-water. However, "
"exposure-based (L1) assessments can be used to estimate additional risk-"
"metrics through application of CanFlood’s scaling parameters (e.g., "
"estimating crop-loss by multiplying the area inundated by some loss/area "
"constant). Exposure-based (L1) assessments can incorporate an assessment "
"of defense failure if exposure probability data is available "

"Many developed areas in Canada rely on some form of flood defense "
"infrastructure (e.g., levees or drainage pumps) to reduce the exposure of"
" assets. Any such infrastructure has the potential to fail during a flood"
" event. Ignoring this failure potential (P :sub:`fail` =0) will "
"underestimate the real flood risk in an area (negative model bias). "
"Assuming such infrastructure will always fail (P :sub:`fail` =1) can "
"drastically overestimate flood risk (positive model bias). Either "
"assumption will reduce confidence in the model and the quality of any "
"flood management decisions made from it. In many areas in Canada, flood "
"protection plays such a significant role in exposure mechanics that a "
"binary treatment of failure probability (P :sub:`fail` = 0 or 1) would "
"render the model’s calculated risk metric useless. Recognizing the "
"importance of flood protection infrastructure in Canadian flood risk "
"management, CanFlood Risk (L1) and Risk (L2) workflows facilitate the "
"incorporation of defense failure into risk calculations."

"A common application of this capability is the incorporation of levee "

"discretizing the levee into segments, estimating the influence area of a "
"breach along each segment (for event *j*), estimating the conditional "

"*The GAR Atlas global flood hazard assessment uses a probabilistic "
"approach for modelling riverine flood major river basins around the "
"globe. This has been possible after compiling a global database of "
"stream-flow data, merging different sources and gathering more than 8000 "
"stations over the globe in order to calculate the range of possible "
"discharges from very low to the maximum possible scales at different "
"locations along the rivers. The calculated discharges were introduced in "
"the river sections to model water levels downstream. This procedure "
"allowed for the determination of stochastic event-sets of riverine floods"
" from which hazard maps for several return periods (25, 50, 100, 200, "
"500, 1000 years) were obtained. The hazard maps are developed at 1kmx1km "
"resolution and have been validated against satellite flood footprints "
"from different sources (DFO archive, UNOSAT flood portal) performing well"
" especially for big events For smaller events (lower return periods), the"
" GAR Atlas flood hazard maps tend to overestimate with respect to similar"
" maps produced locally (hazard maps where available for some countries "
"and were used as benchmark). The main issue being that, due to the "
"resolution, the GAR Atlas flood hazard maps do not take into account "
"flood defenses that are normally present to preserve the value exposed to"
" floods.*"
