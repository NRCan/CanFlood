description=Flood risk modelling toolbox
version=1.2.0
author=Seth Bryant
email=nicky.hastings@canada.ca
about=Provides a suite of tools for building, running, and analyzing simple flood risk models from typical asset and exposure data. Includes a tool for performing fragility calculations on dikes, downloading common flood vulnerability function libraries for buildings, and connecting to useful Canadian web-data. While the focus of the plugin is using depth-damage curves to estimate annualized flood risk from tangible building damages, the flexibility of the framework facilitates calculation of a wide-range of vulnerabilities from user-provided functions.
